[Solved: cron question about multiple commands - Hewlett Packard Enterprise Community](https://community.hpe.com/t5/System-Administration/cron-question-about-multiple-commands/td-p/3444393)
```

Re: cron question about multiple commands
"echo ; ls" will execute both echo and ls, whatever is echo exit code.

"echo && ls" will execute ls only if echo exit code is 0.

Maybe you should do a script. Complex lines in crontab make it not clear and harder to maintain.

Regards,

Fred

我有做個小實驗，簡單來講exit code`;`會傳回最後一個
但是`&&`會兩個看有沒有有沒有成功
